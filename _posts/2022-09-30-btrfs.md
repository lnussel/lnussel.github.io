## Intro

## Status quo in openSUSE

The following diagram shows how BTRFS subvolumes are mounted on a
typical file system tree of a default openSUSE installation 
in 2022:

![tree1](/images/2022-09-30-btrfs/tree_btrfs1.png "filesystem tree from btrfs viewpoint")

The green volume is the root directory (ie the operating system)
volume which is snapshotted. It also contains for example /boot and
/etc. So kernel, initrd and bootloader as well as any configuration
is contained in a single snapshot. The violet volumes are considered
data volumes and are not snapshotted.

### how subvolumes look like

The way this translates to actual BTRFS subvolumes is a bit funny:
![subvolumes1](/images/2022-09-30-btrfs/tree_subvolumes1.png "btrfs subvolumes")

The root directory of the BTRFS volume contains an "@" subvolume.

There's nothing in that subvolume except for other subvolumes. So
there's "home", "opt", etc.
Then there's the subvolume ".snapshots" that contains metadata for
each snapshot of the operating system's root directory, as well as
the subvolumes that actually contain the operating systems' root
directory.

On a traditional system one of those snapshot subvolumes is is
writable and flagged as the BTRFS default subvolume. So when
mounting the device holding the BTRFS file system one would see an
operating system tree rather than the lonely "@" directory. In fact
in a booted system neither the actual root of the BTRFS volume nor
the "@" subvolume ever gets mounted.

Snapshots are created by creating a new read-only subvolume based on
the current root fs.
A rollback is done by creating a new read-write subvolume based on a
read-only snapshot and flagging it as btrfs default subvolume.
That means in /@.snapshots there might be a mix of read-only and
read-write subvolumes. Some read-writes subvolumes might be broken
systems and one is the currently used root fs.

## Gedankenexperiment

### Alternative interpretation of the "@" subvolume

The [Arch Linux wiki article for
snapper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/snapper) describes a different use of
the "@" subvolume. Translated to an openSUSE system the subvolumes would look
like this:

![subvolumes-arch](/images/2022-09-30-btrfs/tree_subvolumes_arch.png "btrfs subvolumes in arch linux")

In that model the "@" subvolume always is the operating system's
root directory tree. The data subvolumes are in parallel to "@", not
below.

So here snapshots would always be read-only.
Roll-back is slightly more complex though. The "@" subvolume has to
be moved out of the way (probably to a new snapshot directory), then
the source snapshot can be snapshotted into a new "@".

### Auto discovering snapshots

Both previously described approaches have the disadvantage that
the naming does not reflect the relation between snapshotted
subvolume and the actual snapshots. So in case other subvolumes also
should get snapshot there is no obvious way how to name that.

A possibility to solve the issue would be to remove the extra
subvolume for snapshots and instead append the revision number with
a separator character directly to the snapshotted subvolume.
Following a
[suggestion](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2021-November/047079.html)
inspired by the [discoverable partition
specification](https://systemd.io/DISCOVERABLE_PARTITIONS/) naming
of subvolumes could look like this:

![subvolumes-new](/images/2022-09-30-btrfs/tree_subvolumes_new1.png "btrfs subvolumes new")

Ie a subvolume name would tell where it want's to be mounted, the OS
it's for and also the architecture.

This method would now allow to have for example /usr on a separate subvolume
with separate snapshotting:

![subvolumes-new](/images/2022-09-30-btrfs/tree_subvolumes_new2.png "btrfs subvolumes with /usr")

The naming makes clear what's the purpose of each subvolume. This allows to
have e.g. systemd generator to create mount units.
