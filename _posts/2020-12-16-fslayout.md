## Intro

A traditional Linux file system tree in the root file system has
quite a number of directories with special purpose, documented in
the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
(FHS)](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/index.html).
An operating system installation by default populates most of those
directories with differerent kinds of files, eg by means of a
package manager. This article analyzes the situation and proposes a
radical simplification.

## Traditional file system tree

The following diagram shows such a traditional file system tree as used by a
default openSUSE installation on a classical filesystem such as ext4 in 2020:

![tree1](/images/2020-12-16-fslayout/tree1.png "traditional filesystem tree")

The colors visualize different kinds of files while gradients indicate a mix of
types on the same file system.

The file types according to color are the following:
- ![legend](/images/2020-12-16-fslayout/config.png "configuration")
  Those are files that are usually written once by the admin or a
  config tool to configure operating system features or services and
  once that's done only read. Traditionally in `/etc`.
- ![legend](/images/2020-12-16-fslayout/data.png "data") Created by
  users or services. Such as documents, images, videos or personal
  files of users. For services for example databases or caches. The
  operating system may also produce data such as log files. Data is
  both read and written frequently. Such files are located below
  `/var`. For example `/var/log` or
  `/var/cache`. `/var/lib` is an application specific hierarchy
  where anything can be stored.
- ![legend](/images/2020-12-16-fslayout/boot.png "boot") boot
  loader files, kernels and initial ramdisks.
- ![legend](/images/2020-12-16-fslayout/os.png "operating system")
  Shipped as packages or image by the operating system vendor. Only
  written during installation or upgrade of the system. Otherwise
  considered read-only. Those files would be overwritten on updates
  of OS components. In a traditional system those are installed in
  root filesystem `/` as well as `/usr`. However also in `/etc`,
  `/srv`, `/opt` and `/var`, mixing with user or service created
  files.
- ![legend](/images/2020-12-16-fslayout/tmp.png "virtual") For
  example anything on tmpfs. Also virtual file systems that are
  kernel interfaces eg /proc, `/sys`, `/dev` etc. The content is
  lost after boot or managed by the kernel anyways.

An example of mixed file type is `/etc`. The operating system ships files that
are not actually meant to be modified like `/etc/profile`, or worse
`/etc/ld.so.cache` which isn't even a config file at all.
A typical workstation mounts `/home` from a separate partition. This is
visualized by the puzzle piece. Also, the EFI boot partition is
mounted into `/boot/efi`.

## BTRFS, snapshots and transactional mode

With the introduction of BTRFS, the operating system gained the
ability to take snapshots and roll back the system in case of
troublesome updates. So it was required to define what should be
part of a snapshot and what not. User documents for example must not be rolled
back. Also databases can't really be snapshotted nor rolled back by the OS as
the structure is application specific and follows it's own transaction
mechanism. The usual configuration files in `/etc` need to be rolled
back though as some are tied to the software version installed.

That lead to separation of `/root`, `/var`, `/srv`, `/opt` and
`/usr/local` into an extra five separate subvolumes. `/tmp` now
usually even resides on tmpfs. That means the operating system's
package manager cannot really install files in those directories
anymore, otherwise a rollback would lead to an inconsistent package database.
So the number of locations with mixed OS files and data got reduced at the cost
of more subvolumes.

The following diagram shows a typical file system tree a default
openSUSE installation on BTRFS in 2020:

![tree2](/images/2020-12-16-fslayout/tree2.png "introduction of btrfs,
snapshots and transactional mode")

In transactional mode (eg MicroOS) there's a further complication. The green
parts of the tree are read-only at runtime. So the writable parts of `/etc` are
actually located below `/var`. An overlayfs makes those files appear in
`/etc/`.

## Grouping and separating by data type

The data on the violet partitions is actually of similar kind.
Is there any gain by having separate partitions or subvolumes for
those by default? Probably not. So in order to reduce the amount of subvolumes
again they could be moved into the `/var` volume. For example `/var/home`,
`/var/srv` and so on with the original directory as symlink. If the workload is
known exactly, an admin could still make an educated decision to have separate
partitions.

![tree3](/images/2020-12-16-fslayout/tree3.png "one var")

With that simplification only `/boot` and `/etc` still mix OS files with other
types.

### Boot files

The initramfs is generated by a script, triggered by package installation. The
boot loader files (usually grub2) are managed via scripts. By moving the kernel
image out of `/boot` and into the operating system space, eg `/usr/lib/linux`,
`/boot` would become entirely managed by scripts. Since modern system have an
EFI boot partition anyways, that partition could just be used for
`/boot` directly.

![tree9](/images/2020-12-16-fslayout/tree9.png "separate /boot")

### Config files

There are already ongoing efforts to move all files in `/etc` to `/usr` that
are not actually meant to be edited or only serve as default, for example
[`/usr/etc`](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_UsrEtc).

So then /etc would actually only contain locally generated configuration (eg by
the admin). Therefore it could actually be separated from the rest of the
operating system and the OS tree can become read-only.

For MicroOS that would mean that when there are no longer OS files in `/etc`,
the underlay would basically be empty, therefore the need for an overlay
vanishes and `/etc` can become it's own (sub)volume without further tricks.

![tree10](/images/2020-12-16-fslayout/tree10.png "separate /etc")

This new tree no longer has any directories with mixed file types.

## UsrMerge

What's left is an operating system that owns the root file
system and `/usr`. The split between `/` and `/usr` is actually
a legacy concept that no longer applies. The initramfs can mount
all partitions just fine, so there's no need to have operating
system files directly in `/` anymore. Other vendors already merged
all operating system files into
[`/usr`](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/UsrMove) to further
simplify things:

![tree7](/images/2020-12-16-fslayout/tree7.png "usr on /")

## `/` without OS

Now there's basically nothing left on `/` that needs to be shipped by the OS.
Just a bunch of mount points and symlinks that point to `/var` or `/usr`. Since
the operating system's package manager has no other business outside of `/usr`,
the actual root directory could be assigned to the `/etc/` volume.

![tree6](/images/2020-12-16-fslayout/tree6.png "/ on /etc partition")

## Potential

With that clear separation of file types an OS tree limited to `/usr`
there's potential to use the system in new ways

- It does not matter whether `/usr` is actually mounted from a
  static image, network or locally installed and updated by a package manager.
  Ie both the transactional-update mechanism as of today as well as an A/B
  scheme would be possible, even in parallel.
- The entire `/usr` tree as a whole could be replaced atomically at runtime
  without reboot.
- an overlayfs for `/etc` is no longer needed in transactional mode
- Config files can and have to be snapshotted independently of the OS tree.
- A system can boot with empty `/etc` and `/var` just based on
  operating system defaults coming from `/usr`. Resetting a system
  can be done by erasing those directories.
- Stateless systems (including eg salt managed ones) could be built
  by mounting `/` including `/etc` as tmpfs. That may include `/var`
  or could mount it from disk to still have data/containers on disk.
- Since the files in `/usr` are read-only, independent of any
  configuration, such a tree created from packages could be
  used as shared runtime for containers or apps (eg flatpak).
- `/boot` on a trivial file system can remove the need for very
  complex boot loaders like grub. Also means the boot loader does
  not have to decrypt the disk to load the kernel in case of full
  disc encryption.

## Consequences and TODO

- The operating system packages have to be limited to ever only ship
  files in `/usr`. Anything else would be out of scope. Ie the UsrMerge has to
  be implemented.
- package scriptlets (%post etc) can no longer modify anything outside `/usr`,
  including `/etc`. A concept for config and data migration scripts would be
  needed. Ie similar to how web applications migrate SQL databases back and
  forth on upgrades or downgrades.
- A new application has to manage `/boot`, ideally according to the
  [systemd boot loader specification](https://systemd.io/BOOT_LOADER_SPECIFICATION/).
  Depending on whether the boot loader in use can read the OS partition, the
  kernel may have to be copied there. The application needs to be aware of
  snapshots and know which kernel/initrd combination boots what snapshot.
- update-alternatives in it's current form with symlinks to `/etc`
  does not work anymore as the `/usr` tree is not functional without
  it. A replacement needs stay within `/usr` boundaries.
- In order to auto discover the actual OS ie `/usr` tree in case a system boots
  up with empty config, the partitioning scheme has to adhere to the
  [discoverable partition](https://systemd.io/DISCOVERABLE_PARTITIONS/) specification.
  A similar spec would be required for the case where the OS tree is actually
  BTRFS subvolumes.

## Summary

A traditional Linux file system layout already carries the idea to
separate the OS, config and data. Actually storing those different
types of files in separate locations and limiting the scope of
package management was never implemented with all consequences.
Doing so would be a major but still evolutionary step that makes
small systems simpler while retaining all flexiblity of todays
systems. With the new layout it's possible to use the same
technology and (binary)packages for building traditional Linux
systems as well as new, compact systems for Edge/IoT, set-top boxes
or routers and container hosts and runtimes with very little effort.

## Appendix

### Volume properties

With the files separated and stored on BTRFS as outlined in this
article, the subvolumes resp partitions holding the content can have
different properties

| Category | RW  | CoW | Snapshot |
|----------|-----|-----|----------|
| config   | no  | yes | yes      |
| data     | yes | no  | no       |
| boot     | no  | no  | no       |
| OS       | no  | yes | yes      |

The OS and config volumes can leverage copy-on-write benefits as
well as snapshotting. The boot volume might be a simple file system
such as FAT (EFI boot partition for example), so advanced file
system features cannot be expected there. Only the data volume needs
to be permanently writeable.
